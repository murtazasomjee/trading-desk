Q4 EPS $3.81 vs $3.05 expected (+25%), fastest revenue growth in 2 years (+12% YoY), $50B buyback announced, Agentforce at $800M ARR with 29,000 deals. Stock was -28% YTD pre-earnings despite best print in enterprise software history. Market overly punishing AI disruption fears (\"SaaSpocalypse\") — a $50B buyback at these prices is enormous. Coiled spring setup."

Stock-specific move — peers MKC, HRL, CPB all down on the same day. Elliott Management activist pressure adding catalyst. Broke above $109–111 resistance on heavy volume. Day 1 of post-earnings move, not a chase."

High-risk speculative position — entered only after stock held above $44 confirmation level."
